# Graduation Project 
In a world that is increasingly digital, ransomware, malware, phishing, web-based and web application attacks, distributed denial of service (DDoS), identity theft, data breaches, botnets, cyberespionage, to name only a few of the main types of cyberattacks, have become more and more sophisticated. And they are sometimes combined to carry out crime, sabotage, espionage and destabilisation. Their actors may be individuals defending a cause (so-called ‘hacktivists’) but more often criminal groups working indifferently for mafias or rogue governments anywhere in the world. They are also on the rise and costly.

Despite the many remaining questions about the future of cybersecurity and governance, we must take into account that international cooperation is the key element in addressing the growing threats of cybercrime.

Keeping people online more secure is a huge task and no entity or government has the perfect solution. Nevertheless, much can be done to intensify prevention and improve the response to cybercrime

`Problematic:`

Because proof-of-work requires solving a cryptographic puzzle before anyone else, compute power plays a significant part in the strategy to win. This has led to many debates around energy consumption and its effects on the climate.

Most proof-of-stake protocols, including Algorand’s, do not require large amounts of energy to produce a block.

All transactions on the blockchain are public,traceable and permanently stored in the blockchain for anyone to observe.

The evidences are not linked to any specific entity.

# **How will blockchain benefit my application?**

*Blockchain, at its core, is a technology that innovates on how we transfer value.* So, if your application exchanges value in some way, blockchain may be a candidate technology to bring your application to the next level.

But before jumping in, it is important to understand specifically how it might benefit your application so that you can design a system that targets those benefits and doesn’t add unnecessary complexity to other parts of your application. This usually maps to thinking about which components to put “on-chain” versus “off-chain”.
